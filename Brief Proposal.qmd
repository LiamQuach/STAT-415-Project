**Project Type:** Option 1 - Full Bayesian data analysis in a new context (survival analysis)

## Context and Research Question

The Telco Customer Churn dataset is a fictional dataset created by IBM to simulate customer data for a telecommunications company. This dataset was designed to help predict customer churn, referring to customers who stop using the companyâ€™s services, with the goal of analyzing customer behavior and developing strategies to retain customers.

### Creation of Dataset

This dataset simulates customer data for a telecommunications company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California during the third quarter.

### Variables

The dataset contains 21 columns:

-   CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
-   Gender: The gender of the customer (Male, Female).
-   SeniorCitizen: Indicates whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
-   Partner: Indicates whether the customer has a partner (Yes, No).
-   Dependents: Indicates whether the customer has dependents (Yes, No).
-   Tenure: The number of months the customer has been with the company.
-   PhoneService: Indicates whether the customer has a phone service (Yes, No).
-   MultipleLines: Indicates whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes, No, No phone service).
-   InternetService: The type of internet service the customer has (DSL, Fiber optic, No).
-   OnlineSecurity: Indicates whether the customer has online security (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   OnlineBackup: Indicates whether the customer has online backup (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   DeviceProtection: Indicates whether the customer has device protection (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   TechSupport: Indicates whether the customer has tech support (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   StreamingTV: Indicates whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   StreamingMovies: Indicates whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   Contract: The type of contract the customer has (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
-   PaperlessBilling: Indicates whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes, No).
-   PaymentMethod: The payment method used by the customer (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card).
-   MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer monthly.
-   TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer over the tenure.
-   Churn: Indicates whether the customer churned (Yes, No).

### Time to Event and Censoring Variables

-   Time to event variable: Amount of months until the customers discontinues service with the company (represented by the column tenure).
-   Right Censoring: Right censoring may occur if a customer does not discontinue service with the company throughout the time of the study (represented by the column Churn).

### Research Question

> *How do customer characteristics (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure) influence the likelihood of churn?*

## Proposed Bayesian Model

-   **Model Type:** Bayesian Proportional Hazards Model

-   **Likelihood:** Weibull likelihood `tenure`, with `Churn` as the event indicator. This was chosen based on preliminary data analysis (Parametric Survival Analysis)

-   **Link Function:** log link

-   **Priors:**

      -   Regression Coefficients: Normal(0, 1); A weakly informative prior with a variance of 1 to allow for a reasonable range of effect sizes.
      -   Weibull Shape Parameter: Half Normal(1); This prior places more probability on smaller values, reflecting our initial expectation that the hazard may be decreasing or constant early on.
      -   Weibull Scale Parameter: Normal(0, 1)
      
-   **Predictors:** To mirror our frequentist cox regression, we will use the same predictors: Partner, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, DeviceProtection, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, TotalCharges

## Planned Analyses

-   Fit the model using `brms`.
-   Summarize posterior distributions for coefficients (credible intervals, posterior means).
-   Posterior predictive checks to assess model fit.
-   Sensitivity analysis using alternative priors.
-   Compare to frequentist cox regression results.
-   Use model to generate posterior predicted probabilities for new data.
