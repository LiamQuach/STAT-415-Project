**Title:**
Bayesian Logistic Regression for Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company

**Team Members:**
Liam Quach, Andrew Kerr

**Project Type:**
Option 1 – Full Bayesian data analysis in a new context (logistic regression)


### **Context and Research Question**

Customer churn—when a customer discontinues service—is a major concern for subscription-based companies. The **Telco Customer Churn dataset** from Kaggle provides customer information including contract details, demographics, and service usage. Our goal is to **build a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate the probability of churn based on customer attributes**.

**Research Question:**

> *How do customer characteristics (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure) influence the likelihood of churn?*



### **Data Description**

* **Source:** [Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* **Sample Size:** \~7,000 observations
* **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)
* **Predictors:**

  * Continuous: `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
  * Categorical: `Contract`, `InternetService`, `PaymentMethod`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Gender`

We will preprocess categorical variables using dummy encoding and scale numeric features.



### **Proposed Bayesian Model**

* **Model Type:** Bayesian Logistic Regression
* **Likelihood:** Bernoulli likelihood for binary outcome `Churn`
* **Link Function:** Logit
* **Priors:**

  * Coefficients: Normal(0, 5)
  * Intercept: Normal(0, 10)
* **Justification of Priors:** Weakly informative priors to reflect baseline uncertainty while preventing overfitting.



### **Planned Analyses**

* Fit the model using `brms` or `rstanarm` in R.
* Summarize posterior distributions for coefficients (credible intervals, posterior means).
* Posterior predictive checks to assess model fit.
* Sensitivity analysis using alternative priors.
* Compare to frequentist logistic regression results.
* Use model to generate posterior predicted probabilities for new data.



### **Deliverables**

* Reproducible report in Quarto or RMarkdown
* Code and plots (diagnostics, posteriors, PPC)
* Summary of findings and comparison with frequentist approach
